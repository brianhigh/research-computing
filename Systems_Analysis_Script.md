Introduction
========================================================

Investing time and money into a computer or information system without a clear course of action can be expensive and wasteful. By taking some time to fully consider the issue at hand and pursue a disciplined approach to finding a practical solution, you greatly increase your odds of success and decrease costs. We call this process *Systems Analysis*.


Systems Development Life Cycle
========================================================

Systems analysis is an important part of an overall approach to *systems design*.

The life of an information system follows a cycle. The classic development model is called
the Systems Development Life Cycle, or SDLC.

Planning Phase
--------------

The [Planning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle#System_investigation)  phase defines the primary issue (*problem* or *goal*) and performs a [feasibility study](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasibility_study). Here, you clarify the project scope, compare your best options, and come up with a plan.

Analysis Phase
--------------

The [Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle#System_analysis) phase focusses on the issue, defined previously, and studies its role in the current (or proposed) 
system. The system is explored, piece by piece, in light of the project goals, to determine system requirements.

Design Phase
------------

In the [Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle#Design) phase, a detailed model of the proposed system is created. Various components or modules address each of the requirements identified earlier.

Implementation Phase
--------------------

During the [Implementation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation#Information_Technology_.28IT.29) phase, a working system is built from the design and put into use.

Maintenance Phase
--------------------

The [Maintenance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_maintenance) includes ongoing 
updates and evaluation. As changes are needed, the cycle repeats with more planning, analysis, and so on.

What will you need?
========================================================

Essentially, in *[Systems analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis)* we answer the question, "*What will you need* to reach your goal?" In other words, **"What are your requirements?"**

A **primary goal** of this course is to help you develop your skills in *[requirements analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis)*.

[Systems analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis) helps you **clarify your project needs** and **plan ahead** in order to *obtain and allocate* **critical resources**.

The main idea here is ...

> If you don't *know* what you *need*, how can you *ask* for it?

Systems Analysis
========================================================

After completing an initial [feasibility study](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasibility_study) to "determine if creating a new or improved system is a viable solution", proposing the project, and gaining approval from [stakeholders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_stakeholder), you may then conduct a [systems analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis). 

[Systems analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis) will involve "[breaking down](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure) the system in different pieces to analyze the situation, **analyzing project goals**, breaking down what needs to be created and attempting to **engage users** so that **[definite requirements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis)** can be defined."

Systems Analysis Definition
========================================================

So, what, exactly, *is* "Systems Analysis"?

"A *system* is a set of interacting or interdependent components"<sup style="font-size:.5em">1</sup>
*Analysis* means "to take apart"<sup style="font-size:.5em">2</sup>

Lonnie D. Bentley, author of *Systems Analysis and Design for the Global Enterprise*, writes:

>[Systems analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis) is a problem solving technique that decomposes a system into its component pieces for the purpose of the studying how well those component parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose.<sup style="font-size:.5em">3</sup>

We will accomplish this analysis by working through a series of [five phases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis#Information_technology).

Systems Analysis Phases
========================================================

Systems Analysis has its own series of phases. We will look at each of these one by one.

![systems analysis phases](./images/systems_analysis_01.png)

----

During [Scope definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_%28project_management%29), we establish our system boundaries. In our [Problem analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_statement) phase, we identify the symptoms and causes. Our [Requirements analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis) determines our system goals. The [Logical design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_design#Logical_design) phase models relationships within the system. And our [Decision analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis) evaluates the various alternatives.

</small>

Scope Definition
========================================================

So, do we mean by *scope*?

> **Scope** involves *getting information* required to start a project, and the *features* the product would have that would meet its *stakeholders requirements*.

Put another way, *project* scope defines the *work to be done* whereas *product* scope is concerned with the *desired features and functions*.

By being careful to define scope *early on*, we can be more watchful for *scope creep*.

> **Scope creep** is [...] the *incremental expansion* of the scope of a project [...], while nevertheless *failing to adjust* schedule and budget.

</small>

Problem Analysis
========================================================

Problem analysis is critical. When we say, *problem*, we can also think *goal*, *research question*, or *issue*. If you don't get this right, you can waste a lot of time and money solving the *wrong problem* or address a *non-issue*.

We can summarize the key points of problem analysis (with some help from Jenette Nagy of Kansas University) as:

> Define and clarify the problem (or issue)

*What exactly are we trying to solve?*

> Determine the problem's importance

*How much does it matter?*

> Assess the feasibility of solving the problem

*Do we have the resources we need?*

> Consider any negative impacts (unintended consequences)

*What could go wrong?*

> Prioritize problems to solve (bottlenecks? low-hanging fruit?)

*What are the most critical issues?*

> Answer: *what*, *why*, *who*, *when*, *where*, and *how much*?

*Drill down into the problem with all kinds of questions to expose dependencies.*

> Find **causes** (especially [root cause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause_analysis)) and **symptoms** (effects)

*What is really going on here?*

Root Cause Analysis
========================================================

There are several methods of root cause analysis, but one simple one is ...

*"Ask Why Five Times"*

![Ask Why Five Times](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Root_Cause_Analysis_Tree_Diagram.jpg)

... where you keep asking "Why? But, why? But, Why?" over and over again until there is a clear root cause that you can actually do something about.

An real example is mentioned in [Ask Why 5 Times, Business Analysis Guidebook/Root Cause Analysis (wikibooks.org)](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Business_Analysis_Guidebook/Root_Cause_Analysis#Ask_Why_5_Times), where the US National Park Service was able to slow the rate of deterioration of the Jefferson memorial simply by changing the lighting schedule.

This method may also be used in Requirements Analysis.

Requirements Analysis
========================================================

- [Elicit, Analyze, and Record (EAR)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis#Overview):
  * System and project [requirements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis)

EAR Analysis is all about *listening*.

Gather requirements by interviewing stakeholders. Observe how people currently do their work or use the system. Make sure the requirements are detailed, clear, unambigious, and comprehensive. Document the requirements as a list, in diagrams, or narratives.

As an example, in Spring 2015, we held a meeting with our graduate students and asked them about what sort of computing needs they had. We had a discussion, *listened* to what they had to say, summarized the main concerns, and documented them.

- Further elucidate [Measurable goals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis#Measurable_goals)

By continuing to ask questions like "Why? ... Why? ... Why? ...", get more specific until the goals become quantifiable. Measured goals are easier to meet since you can measure your progress in achieving them.

Mission objectives determine the goals. Compare the stated goals against mission objectives to produce a small set of critical, measured goals.

- Output: [Requirements specification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_specification)

This document will be used in the *logical design* phase to model the relationships within the system. So, it should be clear and thorough. The more specific and unambiguous this specification is, the easier it will be to design the system to meet the requirements.

One way to be more clear is to organize the requirements by type.

[Types of requirements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis#Types_of_Requirements):
- Operational
- [Functional](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement)
- [Non-functional](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement)
- [Architectural](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_architecture)
- Behavioral
- Performance
- (Others...)

Requirements Modeling: Example
========================================================

Another way to make requirements clear is through *requirements modeling*. Here is an example of modeling behavioral requirements through with a [Use Case Diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case).

**Survey Data System**

The behavioral requirements are stated in **role** *goal* format.

- **Researcher** *uploads survey*.
- **Subject** *takes survey*.
- **Subject** *uploads results*.
- **Researcher** *downloads results*.

Gramatically speaking, the role is the *subject* and the goal is stated as a *verb* and its *object*. Each of these requirements forms the basis of a *use case*.

----

The [Use Case Diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case) is a standard means of showing these requirements pictorially.

Here, human *actors* are depicted as stick figures. These are the **roles**. The goal is the line connecting the role to a system activity of function, shown as an oval. In this example, the *system* is drawn as a box with the actors outside the box. The reason is that the system's *product scope* was defined to be electronic data system. The human actors interact with that system. The information flowing to and from an actor will be modeled in the *logical design*.

Decision Analysis
========================================================


[Decision analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis) involves ...
- Presentation of alternatives:
  * What to buy or build?
- Evaluation of alternatives:
  * Assess the "pros and cons"
  * Compare against requirements
- Make a recommendation to stakeholders
- Get a decision from stakeholders
