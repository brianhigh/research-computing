## Load the iris dataset

```{r dataframe1}
data(iris)
colnames(iris)
head(iris)
```

## Access the columns and rows

The `i`th entry in column `j` can be accessed using `[i,j]`

```{r dataframe2}
iris[3,2]    ### third entry in the second column
```

Columns can also be accessed by name

```{r dataframe3}
head(iris$Sepal.Width)
```

and indexed by entry as before

```{r dataframe4}
iris$Sepal.Width[3]
```

## Access items by a vector of indicies

In addition, rather than just putting a single integer in `[]` 
(as in `iris$Sepal.Width[3]`), one can put a vector of indices in! 
Something like `iris$Sepal.Width[my_index_vector]`. Let's try this:

```{r dataframe5}
my_inds <- c(1,3,4)
iris$Sepal.Width[my_inds]
iris$Sepal.Width[c(1,2,5)]
iris$Sepal.Width[1:3]
```

## Access columns by name or number

Columns/variables can be accessed by number (Rather than by name):

```{r dataframe6}
head(iris$Sepal.Width)
head(iris[,2])         ## Sepal.Width is second column
```

An empty index (as above) means "give all the entries", so `iris[,2]` returns 
all of the entries in column `2` of the `iris` dataframe.

## Manipulating Data with Base (aka Basic) `R`

There are two important commands we will go over: `which` and `by` (and others 
that we will not: eg. `apply`, `match`, `sort`, `order`, `max`, `which.max`).

The more important of these is `which`.

## `which()`

`which` takes in a vector with `0` and `1` entries (or `true` and `false`) and 
returns a vector with the indices of the `1` or `true` entries\


```{r base_manip0}
TF <- iris$Species == "versicolor"
head(TF)
head(which(TF))
```

## `which()`

```{r base_manip1}
head(iris[which(TF),])
```

## Summarizing subsets

We can string commands together and use this to summarize subsets of our data

```{r base_manip2}
mean(iris$Sepal.Width[which(iris$Species == "versicolor")])

short_sepal_ind <- which(iris$Sepal.Length < median(iris$Sepal.Length))
mean(iris$Sepal.Width[short_sepal_ind])

short_sepal_versa_ind <- which((iris$Sepal.Length < median(iris$Sepal.Length)) &
		      	       (iris$Species == "versicolor"))
mean(iris$Sepal.Width[short_sepal_versa_ind])
```

## Summarizing with `by()`

Rather than just summarizing for a single ``Species`` we may want to know mean 
``Petal.Length`` for each species. ``by`` comes in handy here: It applies a 
summarizing function to subsets of our data defined by an index (or key):

```{r base_manip3}
by(iris$Sepal.Width, INDICES = iris$Species, FUN=mean)
```

With enough typing, one can generally use these to do whatever one wishes.

## A Better Way!

What I showed before generally ends up requiring a lot of code that is usually 
overly clever, and hard to read/manage.

A cleaner, easier way to do this: Use two packages written by Hadley Wickham, 
`tidyr` and `dplyr`.

## The `dplyr` package

We will cover `dplyr` here. The 7 `dplyr` commands are:

- `select()`
- `filter()`
- `summarise()`
- `group_by()`
- `arrange()`
- `join()`
- `mutate()`

In addition there is a new operator `%>%` (piping operator) which is an 
easier-to-read way to combine functions.

```{r}
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
```

## `select()`

`select` takes a dataframe, and grabs only some of the columns/features.

```{r}
head(select(iris, Sepal.Width, Species))
head( iris %>% select(Sepal.Width, Species) )
```

## `select()` with `%>%` "pipe"

```{r}
iris %>% select(Sepal.Width, Species) %>% head()
```

Notice our use of the piping operator `%>%` (indicating that we "pipe" the 
`iris` data into the `select` function).

## `filter()`

`filter` subsets rows of a dataframe by true/false vectors

```{r}
head( filter( select(iris, Sepal.Width, Species), Species == "versicolor" ))
```

## `filter()` with `%>%`

```{r}
iris %>%
    select(Sepal.Width, Species) %>%
    filter(Species == "versicolor") %>% 
    head()
```

This is basically what we did using `which` in base-R

## `summarise()`

`summarise` calculates a summary statistic on our manipulated data

```{r}

iris %>%
     select(Sepal.Width, Species) %>%
     filter(Species == "versicolor") %>%
     summarise(mean.sepal.width = mean(Sepal.Width))
```

## `group_by()`

`group_by` groups our observations by a categorical variable (the first step of 
a `by`)

```{r}

iris %>%
     select(Sepal.Width, Species) %>%
     group_by(Species) %>%
     summarise(mean.sepal.width = mean(Sepal.Width))
```

This is a cleaner version of our `by` example from earlier.

## `arrange()`

`arrange` orders our data by one of the features

```{r}
head(iris %>%
          select(Sepal.Width, Species) %>%
          arrange(Sepal.Width))
```

## `arrange()`

This can be combined with previous commands:

```{r}
iris %>%
    select(Sepal.Width, Species) %>%
    group_by(Species) %>%
    arrange(Sepal.Width) %>%
    head()
```

## `arrange()` and `summarize()`

... and can even used on summaries.

```{r}
iris %>%
     group_by(Species) %>%
     summarize(mean.sep.wid = mean(Sepal.Width),
               mean.sep.len = mean(Sepal.Length)) %>%
     arrange(mean.sep.wid)
```

## `join()`

Imagine we are analyzing patient information and have two datasets. Both 
datasets are on the same patients; one has clinical information on the patients, 
and another has lab information. `join()` allows us to combine these two 
datasets into one (even if patients are in different orders, so long as they 
have a unique identifier).

`join()` is particularly neat because it has options that allow it to flexibly 
work even if some patients don't have clinical information and others don't 
have lab information.

## `mutate()`

`mutate` adds new features to our data. For example, we might want to work with 
the ratio of width-to-length:

```{r}
iris %>% mutate(ratio.sep = Sepal.Width/Sepal.Length) %>% head()
```

## `mutate()`

```{r}
iris %>%
     mutate(ratio.sep = Sepal.Width/Sepal.Length,
            ratio.pet = Petal.Width/Petal.Length,
            ratio.diff = ratio.sep - ratio.pet) %>%
     group_by(Species) %>%
     summarize(mean.sep.ratio = mean(ratio.sep),
               mean.pet.ratio = mean(ratio.pet),
               mean.ratio.diff = mean(ratio.diff))
```

## Some questions for you to work on!

- How many flowers are there of each `Species`?
- How many flowers are there with `Sepal.Width` greater than the overall mean?
- Of the flowers with `Sepal.Width` greater than the overall mean, how many 
belong to each `Species`?
- For each `Species`, what is the mean `Petal.Length` for those flowers with 
`Sepal.Length` greater than the median `Sepal.Length` within their species?
- Is the ratio of `Sepal.Length/Sepal.Width` different for flowers with 
`Petal.Length` greater than the median vs those with `Petal.Length` less than 
the median? Is this different for different species?
- If you are particularly precocious, then you can answer the above graphically 
by piping your output into `ggplot2`

## `%>%` into `ggplot2`

We can take our output and pipe directly into Hadley Wickham's plotting 
environment `ggplot2`.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
iris %>% mutate(ratio.sep = Sepal.Width/Sepal.Length) %>%
         ggplot(., aes(x=Petal.Width, y=ratio.sep, color=Species)) + geom_point()
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
dev.off()
```

## Another Dataset to play with

```{r}
url <- "http://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/datasets/salary.txt"
salary_dat <- read.table(url)
names(salary_dat)
```

oops!

## Another Dataset to play with

```{r}
salary_dat <- read.table(url, header = TRUE)
names(salary_dat)
```

This data contains salary, rank, and gender information on faculty members in 
various fields at various times. Many faculty members have multiple entries in 
this data (`id` refers to the faculty member)

- Create a dataframe that has a single entry for each `id` which contains the 
`gender` the maximum `salary` for that `id`, and the `rank` at the time of 
that `salary` entry.
- Compare the average `maximum salary` between `male` and `female` professors
- Break this comparison down by `rank`
- Find the `id` of the female professor with the 10th smallest `maximum salary` 
among all female professors
