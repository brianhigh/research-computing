## What is the "command-line"?

When we speak of "the command-line", we are referring to the command-line
interface (CLI) known as the "shell", "terminal", or "console". While many 
data-analysis systems use a command-line interface, today we are specifically
focusing on the general-purpose command-line interface that either comes with
the "operating system" (Windows, OSX, etc.) or one which can be installed 
as a third-party application.

You will find that gaining a solid foundation in command-line skills will 
help prepare you for use of more advanced or specialized systems (such as R) 
which were inspired and influenced by the more general-purpose command-line 
systems.

You can use the command-line to examine, organize, and clean-up data files
before importing into other software applications. For those experienced 
with the command-line, this can be much more efficient and powerful than using
a graphical application. But to achieve these benefits, you will need some
training and practice. So, today, we will invest some time in skill-building.

## The shell

It is called "the shell" because it is an outer layer (interface) surrounding 
an inner core (the operating system), like a shell of a nut (or crustacean).

In practical terms, the shell is an interactive command interpreter and
display system that is accessed through a "terminal" or "console" program.

On Windows systems, this has historically been the DOS shell:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]
Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.

U:\>
```

... or more recently, Powershell:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Windows PowerShell
Copyright (C) 2013 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

PS U:\>
```

## Bash

On most other systems (Apple OSX, Linux, Unix), the standard shell is called
"Bash".

Windows users who have installed GitBash, will also have a Bash terminal:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Welcome to Git (version 1.9.5-preview20150319)


Run 'git help git' to display the help index.
Run 'git help <command>' to display help for specific commands.

xxxxx@MY-PC /h
$
```

We will focus primarily on Bash in today's tutorial, since Bash can run 
on just about any computer system, is free, powerful, and very popular.

## Starting a shell session

To start a command-line session, you will need to open up a "terminal".

* On Windows, you can run "CMD" (or "Powershell") from the Start Menu.
* On Windows, you can launch "GitBash" from the All Programs menu.
* On Mac OSX, you can launch "Terminal" (from Spotlight, etc.)
* On Linux, your terminal program may be called "Terminal", "Xterm", etc.

You can also connect to a Linux or Unix server over SSH to get a shell prompt.

Here we are connection from one Linux system to another using the `ssh` command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
$ ssh -p 54322 xxxxx@phage.deohs.washington.edu
xxxxx@phage.deohs.washington.edu's password: 
Welcome to Bio-Linux on phage (based on Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS)

 * More info at:  http://nebc.nerc.ac.uk/tools/bio-linux

Last login: Fri Dec 25 22:07:19 2015 from yyyyy
xxxxx@phage:~$
```

## The terminal

The software application that you open to get to the shell is actually a 
terminal "emulator". Before the days of graphical computer systems, 
one would access the computer through a text-mode terminal. There was
no mouse and nothing to click on. You just had a keyboard, screen,
the computer, a printer, cables, and maybe a communications device
like a modem. (In earlier days, you had even less.)

Anyway, this terminal emulator may have limited features. Some do not have
very good copy/cut/paste features (like, for example, the DOS command console).

Unix systems (like OSX) and Linux systems tend to have much better terminals
because those systems have a historical tradition of greater use of the
command-line in performing routine tasks. For this same reason, the shell
(such as Bash) on these systems also tends to be more powerful and
user-friendly. (Well, more friendly toward the more experienced user, at least.)

***Note***: In the examples to follow, we will use `/u` as the path to your 
"home directory" since in this computer lab, you have access to a "U Drive" 
which can be addressed in this way. If you want to try these examples on your 
personal computer, subsitute `~` instead. This is an alias to your "home 
directory" (folder). Otherwise, you would need to create a `/u` folder for
the examples to work.

## The prompt

The prompt is just a symbol (> or $, etc.) that let's know the shell is
awaiting commands.

It may have some text in front of it, such as your username, the current
working directory (the folder you are "in"), the date and time, and so on.

You can control this, but often people just leave the prompt with the default
configuration.

Some examples:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
U:\>
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
PS U:\>
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
user@host:folder$
```

## The command-line

A command-line will usually take the form of: 

> command option(s) argument(s)

... where the command is either a built-in shell command or a separate program.

The command may be followed by command options and arguments. 

We will see some exceptions to this general format, but usually this is 
how most shell commands are constructed, as shown in the following examples.

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
cd /u
mkdir -p fee/phi
cd fee
ls
```

We will generally not show the output in our examples. Please try them on your 
own. Generally, Bash commands only show output when output is requested or 
expected by the function of the command. For example, only the last comand 
above (`ls`) should show output, unless you encounter an error.

## Help

You can get help for most Bash commands by adding `-?`, `-h`, or `--help` as 
the only option to the command. (Most DOS commands will take `/?` instead.)

Examples:

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
ls -?
cd -h
mkdir --help
```

If the command does not recognize your option, it may offer some limited help.

If you are using a Linux, Unix, or OSX system with a full set of documentation
installed, you can also bring up "`man` pages":

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
man ls
```

You can navigate this help system with PGUP, PGDN, and SPACE and arrow keys. 
Press `q` to quit.

## Redirection

You can use `>` (overwrite) and `>>` (append) to redirect output to a file.

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
ls *.txt
echo "pho" > fum.txt
ls *.txt
cat fum.txt
```

The `>` symbol redirects the `echo` command output to a file `fum.txt`. If we
used the `>>` instead, this would have appended instead of overwriting. With
either of these, a new file will be created if one does not already exist.

You can also redirect *from* a file to use it as input:

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
< fum.txt
```

In this example, the `<` symbol works like `cat`, reading and displaying the
contents of the file.

## Scripts

Scripts are regular text files which are interpreted by a special program
called an interpreter to execute the commands (code) in the script.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
$ cat myscript.sh 
# This is a comment. It will not be shown in the script output.
cd /u
mkdir -p fee/phi
cd fee
ls
ls *.txt
echo "pho" > fum.txt
ls *.txt
cat fum.txt

$ bash myscript.sh 
phi
ls: *.txt: No such file or directory
fum.txt
pho
```

(The `$` prompt and command output have been included in this example for clarity.)

## Folder navigation and management

For the rest of the tutorial, we will list Bash commands and their DOS
equivalents (where possible) in [brackets].

-   [cd](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cd.html),
    [pwd](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/pwd.html) [cd]
    - **c**hange **d**irectory (folder), **p**rint **w**orking
    **d**irectory (folder). (Note: "working" means the folder you are
    currently working "in".)

-   [mkdir](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/mkdir.html),
    [rmdir](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/rmdir.html) [mkdir
    (or) md, rmdir (or) rd] 
    - **m**a**k**e (create), **r**e**m**ove a
    **dir**ectory (folder)

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
cd /u
mkdir -p bin/scripts
cd bin
pwd
rmdir scripts
cd ..
```

Here, the ".." folder is an alias for the next folder "up" (the "parent") in 
the folder strucure.

## File management commands

-   [ls](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/ls.html), 
    [find](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/find.html) [dir]
    - **l**i**s**t, **find** (search for) files and folders, etc. (using
    pattern matching with a special character syntax called "[glob
    constructs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29)")

-   [cp](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cp.html),
    [mv](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/mv.html),
    [rm](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/rm.html) [copy,
    move, del, ren, rename] 
    - **c**o**p**y, **m**o**v**e, **r**e**m**ove
    (delete), rename files (A move to a new name is a rename.)

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
ls
find . -type d -mtime -1
echo "export PATH=/u/bin:$PATH" > path.txt
cp path.txt bin/
rm -f bin/path.txt
mv path.txt bin/setpath.sh
```

Here, the "." folder is an alias for the current folder. Notice how `find`
takes the file/folder argument **before** the command options. The `/` 
following `bin/` is optional, but helps to identify this as a folder.

## File viewing and retrieval commands

-   [cat](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cat.html) [type]
    - display (or combine, "con**cat**enate") the contents of text files
    (i.e., any screen output is displayed all at once)

-   [more](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/more.html),
    less [more] 
    - "page" (display to screen with pausing) through (long)
    text files (with keyboard navigation)
-   [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/)
    - fetch files from the web

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
cat bin/setpath.sh
curl -o 'iris.csv' \
  'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data'
less iris.csv
```

The `\` is a line-continuation character to allow a long line to be wrapped
into additional lines as needed. We indented the second line to show that this
is actually part of the previous line. **Note**: GitBash does not include `more`.

## Text manipulation commands

-   [echo](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/echo.html) [echo]
    - repeat text (printing it to the terminal screen or redirecting it
    to a file, etc.)

-   [grep](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/grep.html) [find]
    - find text (using pattern matching with a special character syntax
    called "glob constructs" or "[regular
    expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)")

-   [diff](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/diff.html) [fc]
    - show **diff**erences between texts

-   [head](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/head.html),
    [tail](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/tail.html),
    [cut](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cut.html)
    - slice text in various ways: first n lines (**head**), last n lines 
    (**tail**), **cut** (select) specific columns (fields, variables, features)

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
grep 'Iris-virginica' iris.csv
head iris.csv
tail iris.csv
cut -d, -f5 iris.csv
echo "With so many lines, the output runs off the screen!!! What to do???"
```

## Pipes and pipelines

The `pipe` (vertical bar) symbol, `|` streams output into another command 
as input.

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
echo "Let's find lines containing 'Iris-virginica' in the iris data set."
grep 'Iris-virginica' iris.csv | head
grep 'Iris-virginica' iris.csv | tail
grep 'Iris-virginica' iris.csv | cut -d, -f5
```

This allows you to connect commands into a data processing "pipeline".

Command output which would otherwise print to the screen is instead routed to 
the next command in the pipe. Most utilites used in Bash are designed to take 
input from both files and pipes. So, if the command is taking input from a
pipe, you do not use a file argument to the command. For example, `head`,
`tail`, and `cut` as used above do not have a file argument, as they take
their input from the output of `grep`.

As you can imagine, several commands can be strung together to create very
powerful and flexible pipelines to use the utilities in ways their designers
may not have imagined. This is generally not true for "monolithic" applications.

## More text manipulation commands

-   [sort](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sort.html),
    [uniq](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/uniq.html) [sort]
    - **sort** text: alpha-numerically, with or without duplicates (**uniq**ue)
    
-   [wc](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/wc.html)
    - **c**ount **w**ords, lines, and characters in text
    - Example: echo 'fooling' | wc -c    # counts number of characters
-   [sed](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sed.html)
    - **s**tream **e**ditor: make changes to text such as search-and-replace
    - Example: echo 'fooling' | sed 's/o/e/g'    # changes all "o" to "e"

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
cut -d, -f5 iris.csv | sort -u
cut -d, -f5 iris.csv | grep 'Iris' | sort -u | wc -l
cut -d, -f5 iris.csv | grep 'Iris' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
cut -d, -f5 iris.csv | sort -u | grep 'Iris' | sed 's/Iris-//g'
```

## Environment/session commands

-   export [set] 
    - set (environment) variables. (In Bash, "export" makes
    them available to sub-processes. In DOS, "set" is used for
    assignment.)

-   exit [exit] 
    - end (close) the terminal session (and possibly write
    your command history to a file) -- ***but save your terminal output
    first!***

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
echo $PATH
export PATH=/u/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/u/Rtools/bin
echo $PATH
```

By echoing the value of $PATH before and after running
the script, we see that the PATH was indeed changed.

## Configuring a custom default PATH

You can set various configuration options in `~/.bash_profile`. This is a 
special file containing commands that are run when Bash launches. 

Again, the `~` symbol (known as "tilde" or "squiggle") is an alias for your 
home directory (also equivalent to `$HOME` in Bash).

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
echo "export PATH=/u/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/u/Rtools/bin" >> ~/.bash_profile
cat ~/.bash_profile
bash ~/.bash_profile
echo $PATH
```

If you open a new Bash shell and show the value of $PATH you will see the new
path setting. Because we appended with `>>`, we did not overwrite the contents
of the `~/.bash_profile` file.

Note: Some systems use other files, like `~/.bashrc` instead of, or in addition
to, `~/.bash_profile`.

## Exercise

If you have the time and interest, please complete the exercise described in
detail in your 
[lab assignment](https://github.com/brianhigh/research-computing/blob/master/lab/01/rescomp_lab1.md).

This exercise will provide an opportunity for you to apply what you have 
learned in this tutorial with a very practical data exploration example.

Be sure to save your command history (and output) and turn it in for credit 
through Canvas.
