## See network data in transit

First, we will be look at the
flow and contents of network data packets as they leave and enter our
own computers. 

This will reveal what sorts of information someone else
could see if they had the motivation, knowledge and skills to peer into
your network traffic.

***Note***:

> Tools that perform encryption or network reconnaissance may have
> [legal](http://mcaf.ee/cryptolaw) or institutional restrictions on their
> use. Please consult with your information security officer for details.

## Install York or Wireshark

For this exercise, you will need to install one of the two applications 
listed below. York is easier to use. Wireshark is more instructive, but also 
more advanced.

* [York](http://thesz.diecru.eu/content/york.php)
* [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) (for advanced use)

As we do not *entirely* trust the "York" application, please do *not* install 
it on your personally-owned computer and please *reboot* your PC *after* 
you are done with this exercise so that the lab PC will be restored to its 
original state.

To consider: Why might we distrust one application more than the other?

## Configuration

We will show you how to configure York for the next part of the exercise.

Wireshark users may wish to reference a 
[PDF](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1020726/files/33769006/download?wrap=1) 
with screenshots of Wireshark usage for this particular exercise. It also
explains how the test website was configured for HTTP 
[Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

If you are feeling really geeky, you can use 
[tshark](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html), the CLI for 
Wireshark. Hints are available in 
[Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1020726/pages/demo-the-value-of-encryption).

## Packet sniffing

To see network data, you will see a demonstration of York (and maybe Wireshark) for
"sniffing" network "packets". Once your packet sniffing application has been
configured, load the webpage: 
[http://staff.washington.edu/high/rescomp](http://staff.washington.edu/high/rescomp)

This page presents a login prompt. We will log in with a ficticous account:

* Username: test
* Password: sph

This site was created just for this exercise. We would not normally use such a 
simple password and we would certainly not publish the password on the web or
put it in a presentation slide!

## What to turn in

If you have York or Wireshark running and configured properly, you should be 
able to capture the username and password from the network packets that you 
have sent to the webserver. 

Please turn in a screen capture of the captured password as a PNG file or a 
PDF document. (`tshark` users can turn in a text capture instead.)

## Encryption of data "in motion"

Next, we will repeat the previous exercise after we have enabled encryption.

Start capturing packets again with York or Wireshark (or` tshark`).

Simply add an "s" to "http" to get "https" -- and use that with the previous web 'address (URL): 

[https://staff.washington.edu/high/rescomp](https://staff.washington.edu/high/rescomp)

Load that address in your web browser and capture packets. See if you can find the
packets containing the password.

## What to turn in

You should not be able to see the password. If you do, something went wrong. 
So, ideally, there would just be encrypted text. York users would have nothing 
to turn in.

But you are using Wireshark (or tshark), 
you should see the initiation of the encryption session. In those packets, you 
should also see a certificate exchange. 

So, Wireshark users, please capture at least one packet of this certificate 
exchange and turn it in as text, PNG or PDF. We will show you how to do export 
packet information from Wireshark as text.

## What about wireless? U-Drive?

So, we have seen that Ethernet traffic is not encrypted by default. You have to
rely on specific protocols to use encryption.

Is wireless (WiFi) encrypted? If not, how would you encrypt it?

Are file transfers to the U-Drive encrypted? If not, how would you encrypt them?

## Encryption of data "at rest"

You can encrypt files and folders with popular compression utilities like 
[7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/). You
may have 7-Zip on your lab PC. If not, you can install it for free, either
as the full application, or the 
[PortableApp](http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/7-zip_portable) version.

7-Zip is free, open source, and supports many compression formats as well 
as [NIST AES-256](http://www.nist.org/nist_plugins/content/content.php?content.39) 
strong encryion.

This level of encryption is recommended by the U.S. government for 
[top secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)
information.

AES-256 is also used for lots of other applications, such as the 
[LastPass](https://lastpass.com/support.php?cmd=showfaq&id=1096) password 
manager.

## Further protect data with backups

[RoboCopy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee851678.aspx) is a 
very popular utility to make backups of Windows machines from the command-line.

We have a DOS script called 
[mirror.bat](https://github.com/brianhigh/research-computing/blob/master/lab/scripts/mirror.bat) 
that we have shared with you. This script makes it very 
easy to use RoboCopy to "mirror" a folder and then "sync" it once it has been 
mirrored. Feel free to give this a try with a folder on your computer. 

You can mirror "to" or "from" the U:\ drive and then try a sync after changing 
a file. Was the sync faster that the original mirror? If so, what made it 
faster? Would simply copying the entire folder over (each time you sync) be 
just as fast?

## mirror.bat example

Here is how to use the script to backup "MyFolder" from "Documents" to U:

First create the destination folder, then run `mirror.bat`:

```
C:\Users\xxxxx\Documents\> mkdir U:\MyFolder
C:\Users\xxxxx\Documents\> mirror.bat MyFolder U:\MyFolder
```

The backup.log file should be in `U:\MyFolder`. If you run the same command a 
second time, the backup will be overwritten.

## Encrypted backups

But is sending files over the network in this way secure? Is it encrypted?

Could you use 7-Zip with mirror.bat (or similar) to automate AES-256 encrypted
backups? Would syncing of encrypted backups also benefit from the efficient syncing
ability of RoboCopy? If you have the time and interest, give this idea a try.

## What to turn in

If you had time to try `mirror.bat`, please turn in the first few lines of the 
log which show the RoboCopy options and arguments and last few lines of the log
which indicate the transfer stats for the mirror/sync operation. 

This will
indicate that you have successfully used this script to perform the backup. You
do not need to turn in the whole logfile, nor do we need to see anything in
the logfile found between those two sections of the file, such as the long
list of filenames.

## What to turn in: head and tail example

Here is an example of how you can easily capture the beginning and ending of 
the logfile using the `head` and `tail` commands from the `bash` shell:

```
$ head -20 backup.log > backup_report.txt
$ tail -11 backup.log >> backup_report.txt
```

Now, the file `backup_report.txt` can be turned in.

## Other backup options

There are other fancier backup tools, of course. The purpose of sharing this
simple script is to show how backups can be implemented with basic tools. 

Unix, Linux and Mac systems often come with 
[rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) and there are lots of 
tutorials available online on how to use it. Rsync can use SSH for encryption.

Another option that will provide a graphical user interface and AES-256 encryption 
is [Duplicati](http://www.duplicati.com/). We will not have time to try this in
the lab, but you might like to explore it (or other similar tools) on your own.

What do you do for backups? Are they encrypted?

## Security bulletins and updates

Lastly, we will take a quick look at [US CERT](https://www.us-cert.gov/), 
a good source for 
[vulnerablity summaries](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/bulletins/SB16-011), 
[vulnerability notes](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) and 
[current activity](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity).

We have a R script that will help you view and analyze recent bulletins:

* [us-cert-bulletins](https://github.com/brianhigh/us-cert-bulletins)

You can scroll down from that link and just look at the sample output, 
updated for today's lab. (Or you can clone the repo and run the script.) You 
will see a list of recent vulnerabilities and a plot of severity.

Do you run any of these applications? Are you up-to-date? Do these applications 
automatically update themeselves or do you have to do updates manually?
