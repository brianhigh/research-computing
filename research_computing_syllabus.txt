   Course Goals:

   The main goal of this 1-credit class is to help students improve their
   technical readiness for engaging in the increasingly data-centric work
   that they face in their degree programs, in their related research, and in
   their future professional and research practice. Students will become
   acquainted with key concepts in research computing and data management,
   including overviews of systems analysis techniques, data security and
   integrity, and database tools, among others.

   Learning Objectives:

   At the end of this course students should be able to:

     * Analyze requirements for management of data in different situations
       and projects.

     * Choose appropriate technical tools and techniques to support that data
       management.

     * Identify hazards and pitfalls in data-related projects.

     * Identify factors that affect performance in the collection and
       preparation of data for analysis.

     * Describe the core technologies most frequently employed in large-scale
       research data management.

   Requirements:

   The requirements for receiving credit for ENVH 590/BIOST 578: Research
   Computing and Data Management are listed below. Each of these requirements
   will be evaluated to determine whether credit will be given for the
   course.

    1. Participate (10 hours): Come to class and participate in discussions
       and group exercises. Also, contribute to class-related online forums.

    2. Complete assignments, including five online quizzes (10 hours): 
       Quizzes will be based on discussions, readings, and additional course
       content such as videos and exercises. Quizzes will be completed online
       through Canvas.

    3. Complete a term project (10 hours): Each student will complete a term
       project culminating in a “how to” resource: either a short (3-10
       minute) recorded “screencast” presentation or a tutorial document
       including “screenshots”. Some homework will be assigned to help guide
       this effort. The “how to” should demonstrate a computing task
       associated with research computing. Provide project peer-review to
       others through Canvas.

   Readings:

   Readings, videos, exercises, and additional resources will be found on the
   course website. (No textbook)

   Grading:

   This is a credit/no credit course. A grade of 70% or higher is required to
   receive credit based on: participation (35% of grade), five online quizzes
   (30% of grade), a term project (30% of grade), and project peer-review (5%
   of grade).Access and Accommodations:

   Your experience in this class is important to us, and it is the policy and
   practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and
   accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. If
   you experience barriers based on a disability or temporary health
   condition, please seek a meeting with DRS to discuss and address them. If
   you have already established accommodations with DRS, please communicate
   your approved accommodations to your instructor at your earliest
   convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course.

   Disability Resources for Students (DRS) offers resources and coordinates
   reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary
   health conditions.  Reasonable accommodations are established through an
   interactive process between you, your instructor(s) and DRS.  If you have
   not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health
   condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (this can
   include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning,
   vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact
   DRS at 206-543-8924 or uwdrs@uw.edu or disability.uw.edu

   Academic Integrity Statement:

   Students at the University of Washington (UW) are expected to maintain the
   highest standards of academic conduct, professional honesty, and personal
   integrity.

   The UW School of Public Health (SPH) is committed to upholding standards
   of academic integrity consistent with the academic and professional
   communities of which it is a part. Plagiarism, cheating, and other
   misconduct are serious violations of the University of Washington Student
   Conduct Code (WAC 478-120). We expect you to know and follow the
   university's policies on cheating and plagiarism, and the [1]SPH Academic
